# 📌 Objective

Blinkit has launched several new stores in multiple cities and wants to ensure
high operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. You have been given a sample dataset
containing information about orders, customers, and stores to identify key trends, operational
bottlenecks, and strategies for business growth.

# 📌  Overview

This project showcases my work on a SQL-based data analysis problem from Blinkit, where I applied SQL queries to solve various business and data problems. The goal was to extract meaningful insights from a dataset, focusing on sales, customer behaviour, and operational metrics.

# 🛠️ Problem Statement

The problem statement for this assignment can be found in the above pdf. It outlines various data analysis tasks that require writing SQL queries to extract and analyze business-critical metrics.
